- **Super-Resolution Support:** Enhance image resolution using RealESRGAN.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust settings such as seed, temperature, and top-p sampling for better results.
- **Optimized Performance:** Runs on GPU with reduced memory footprint and suppressed warnings for a smooth experience.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch with CUDA support
- Gradio for the interactive UI
- Transformers and other required libraries

### Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio transformers gradio numpy pillow
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### 1. Run the Application
Execute the following command to launch the Gradio-based UI:
```sh
python app.py
```

### 2. Image Understanding
- Upload an image.
- Ask a question related to the image.
- Get AI-generated responses based on the visual content.

### 3. Text-to-Image Generation
- Provide a textual description.
- Adjust parameters such as seed and guidance weight.
- Generate high-quality images using the AI model.

### 4. Super-Resolution
- Enhance images using RealESRGAN for improved clarity and resolution.

## Model Details
- **Model:** `deepseek-ai/Janus-Pro-7B`
- **Processing:** Uses VLChatProcessor for input preparation.
- **Generation:** Supports controlled sampling and token generation for better results.

## Performance Optimization
- **CUDA Support:** Moves computation to GPU if available.
- **Memory Management:** Clears CUDA cache before processing to avoid memory overhead.
- **Suppressed Warnings:** Reduces log noise for a cleaner output.

## Customization
Modify parameters in `app.py` to fine-tune the modelâ€™s behavior:
- `temperature`: Controls randomness in generation.
- `top_p`: Adjusts nucleus sampling.
- `seed`: Ensures reproducibility of results.
